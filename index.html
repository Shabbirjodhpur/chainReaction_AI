			<p>Chain Reaction is a multiplayer game.</p>
			<p>In which the objective is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponents' orbs.</p>
			<p>Players take it in turns to place their orbs in a cell. Once a cell has reached critical mass the orbs explode into the surrounding cells adding an extra orb and claiming the cell for the player.</p>
			<p>A player may only place their orbs in a blank cell or a cell that contains orbs of their own colour. As soon as a player looses all their orbs they are out of the game.</p>
